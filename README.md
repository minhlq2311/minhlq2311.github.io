The Werewolf Online Game is a social deduction web application where players can join as members of either the **Village** or **Wolf** teams. The game is divided into two phases: **Day** and **Night**. During the **Day** Phase, all players discuss and vote to eliminate suspected wolves. In the **Night** Phase, wolves secretly choose a villager to kill, while players with special roles use their abilities. The game continues until either all wolves are eliminated **(Village wins)** or the number of wolves equals or exceeds that of villagers **(Wolf wins)**
