Members of the wolfpack must be good liars. During the day, they must act like a normal villager to avoid being lynched
while still defending their fellow wolves and harm the village. During the night, werewolves kill innocent villagers to
gain further power in the village. The wolfpack wins when the number of living wolfpack members is greater than or equal
to that of the village.
