	<h2 data-text="Starting the Game" class="glitch">Starting the Game</h2>

	<div class="mt-2">
		Games can be created by pressing the button labeled "Host Game" and entering the username you want. While the
		game
		has
		not started, anyone can join if they press "Join Game" in the menu, input the game code, and input their desired
		username.

		To start the game, there must be at least five players and somebody must type the command <c>!start</c>.
		<br>
		If you want to play but can't get enough people you know to play, make the game public! Use the command <c>
			!settings
			public</c> to make the game code be shown in the menu screen to anyone playing. This can always be turned
		off by
		using the same command again.

	<h2 data-text="Roles" class="glitch mt-2">Roles</h2>
	<div class="mt-2">
		Each player has a role, many of which grant special abilities to the player. There are two main types of roles
		which
		are
		reffered to as "factions": the <a href="factions/wolfpack.html">wolfpack</a> and <a
			href="factions/village.html">village</a>. The wolfpack roles have abilities that help them kill village
		members,
		and
		the village roles have abbilites that help them stop the wolfpack and ultimately get rid of them. A list of
		roles,
		sorted by factions, is shown below:

	<h2 data-text="Daytime" class="glitch mt-2">Daytime</h2>

	<div class="mt-2">
		A game is split into daytime and nighttime, both phases lasting anywhere from forty seconds to four minutes and
		ten
		seconds, depending on how much time is needed that day. During the day, messages can be read or sent by any
		player,
		and
		even the automated moderator. Daytime is for questioning players and putting information together to figure out
		who
		the
		werewolves are and lynching them. See the Commands section on this page to learn how to lynch potential
		werewolves.

	</div>
	<h2 data-text="Nighttime" class="glitch mt-2">Nighttime</h2>

	<div class="mt-2">
		During the night, players with special abilities, such as werewolves, have the opportunity to use their
		abilities.
		For
		example, werewolves can choose their victim.
	</div>

	<h2 data-text="Ending the Game" class="glitch mt-2">Ending the Game</h2>

	<div class="mt-2">
		The game ends when either the werewolves number the villagers (note that <a
			href="roles/traitor.html">tratiors</a>
		aren't included in this count), resulting in a victory for the werewolves, or all werewolves have been lynched,
		resulting in a victory for the villagers.
